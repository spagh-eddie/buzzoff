# BuzzOff

This project creates a list of possible words that can be created from a set of letters.
It is definitely not designed to assist with [The New York Times' Spelling Bee puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).
Pinky promise.

To see what words can be made with the set of letters `yaehlpt` that contain `y`, run it!

```console
% python -m buzz off -m y yaehlpt
allay
alley
ally
...
```

## Installation

Install this project with `python -m pip install buzz`.
